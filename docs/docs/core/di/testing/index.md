# Testing Tegral DI code

Tegral DI provides easy-to-use testing facilities for applications that use it as a dependency injection framework. This comes in two parts:

- [Base test classes and test utilities](writing-tests.md) that provides a number of useful methods for dynamically injecting components on the fly.
- A [check system](checks.md) that allows you to test the completeness/correctness of your Tegral DI modules. This requires using [modules](../modules.md) throughout your application.
