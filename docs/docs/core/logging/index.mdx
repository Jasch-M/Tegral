# Tegral Logging

Tegral Logging is a feature that makes it easy to add logging to a Tegral application.

Tegral Logging uses SLF4J behind the scenes, which makes it compatible with any SLF4J-enabled logging system, such as [logback](https://logback.qos.ch).

<PackageVersions libraries={[
    { name: 'tegral-logging', catalog: 'logging' }
]}/>

## Using Tegral Logging

You will need to install the feature like so:

```kotlin
install(LoggingFeature)
```

:::info

Tegral Logging is installed by default when using Tegral Web [AppDefaults](/web/appdefaults/index.mdx)/[AppDSL](/web/appdsl/index.mdx), requiring no additional action

:::

Once installed, Tegral Logging will add a Logger factory within the DI environment. Here is an example of a class that uses Tegral Logging to get its logger:

```kotlin
class MyClass(scope: InjectionScope) {
    // highlight-start
    private val logger: Logger by scope.factory()
    // highlight-end

    fun printSomething() {
        logger.info("Hello World!")
    }
}
```

The name of the logger is automatically determined for the fully qualified name (FQN) of the class that is requesting said logger. Optionally, you can also specify a custom logger name by adding the `@LoggerName` annotation to your class:

```kotlin
// highlight-start
@LoggerName("my.class")
// highlight-end
class MyClass(scope: InjectionScope) {
    private val logger: Logger by scope.factory()

    // ...
}
```
