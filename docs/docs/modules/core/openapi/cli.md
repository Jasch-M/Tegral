# CLI

The Tegral OpenAPI CLI provides an easy and convenient way of converting [OpenAPI scripts](./scripting.md) to proper OpenAPI JSON and YAML files.

The CLI is not currently published. Once published, we will add additional information on how to run the CLI. For now, you can run it from source using, from the root of the Tegral repository:

```bash
gradle :tegral-openapi:tegral-openapi-cli:installDist
tegral-openapi/tegral-openapi-cli/build/install/tegral-openapi-cli/bin/tegral-openapi-cli
```
