# Tegral Services

Tegral Services is a simple API for defining startable and stoppable services.

These services are simply classes that implement `TegralService` and that get put in a [services-enabled](/modules/core/di/extensions/services.md) [Tegral DI](/modules/core/di/index.mdx) environment

In order to make using services easier, Tegral Services also provides a feature (`ServicesFeature`) that automatically sets up the [Tegral DI services extension](/modules/core/di/extensions/services.md) for you when enabled.

<PackageVersions libraries={[
    { name: 'tegral-services-api', catalog: 'services.api' },

]}/>

## Writing services

Services can be written simply by implementing the `TegralService` interface and implementing relevant functions:

```kotlin
class MyService : TegralService {
    override suspend fun start() {
        // ...
    }

    override suspend fun stop() {
        // ...
    }
}
```
