# Tegral Logging

Tegral Logging is a feature that makes it easy to add logging to a Tegral application.

Tegral Logging exposes [SLF4J](https://slf4j.org) loggers and uses [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch) behind the scenes.

<PackageVersions libraries={[
    { name: 'tegral-logging', catalog: 'logging' }
]}/>

## Installation

You will need to install the feature like so:

```kotlin
install(LoggingFeature)
```

:::info

Tegral Logging is installed by default when using Tegral Web [AppDefaults](/modules/web/appdefaults/index.mdx)/[AppDSL](/modules/web/appdsl/index.mdx), requiring no additional action

:::

## Creating loggers

Once installed, Tegral Logging will add a Logger factory within the DI environment. Here is an example of a class that uses Tegral Logging to get its logger:

```kotlin
class MyClass(scope: InjectionScope) {
    // highlight-start
    private val logger: Logger by scope()
    // highlight-end

    fun printSomething() {
        logger.info("Hello World!")
    }
}
```

The name of the logger is automatically determined for the fully qualified name (FQN) of the class that is requesting said logger. Optionally, you can also specify a custom logger name by adding the `@LoggerName` annotation to your class:

```kotlin
// highlight-start
@LoggerName("my.class")
// highlight-end
class MyClass(scope: InjectionScope) {
    private val logger: Logger by scope()

    // ...
}
```

## Logger configuration

Tegral Logging exposes configuration properties that can be used to directly configure logging within your application (without needing to use Logback's `logback.xml`).

### Global logging level

You can confiure the "global" logging level for the entire application like so:

```toml title="/tegral.toml"
[tegral.logging]
level = "Debug"
```

Available values are (from most verbose to least verbose):

- `All`
- `Trace`
- `Debug`
- `Info` (default)
- `Warn`
- `Error`

### Individual loggers

You can also configure individual loggers.

```toml title="/tegral.toml"
[tegral.logging.loggers."org.example.hello"]
level = "Debug"
```

This will configure the `org.example.hello` logger to use the Debug logging level. Make sure you do not forget the quotation marks!

Available logging level values are the same as for the global logging levels.

:::note

Please note that the objective of this configuration section is to provide an easy way of configuring loggers. In case you need more advanced behavior, you should either:

- Use a `logback.xml` file.
- Create your own feature that programmatically configures loggers on the `onConfigurationLoaded` [lifecycle hook](../featureful/index.mdx#lifecycle-features)
