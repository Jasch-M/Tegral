# TW Config

Tegral Web Config is a simple library that only adds the `WebConfiguration` configuration section (i.e. what you use in `[tegral.web]`).

The section is *not* added automatically to the environment by merely just adding this library as a dependency. You will need to have at least one feature referencing it. In the case of full Tegral Web applications, [AppDefaults](/modules/web/appdefaults/index.mdx) handles this.
