Tegral Web is a collection of high-level integration libraries and frameworks to build Tegral applications. These libraries, contrary to Tegral Core, are more intended for users who wish to build full Tegral-based applications.

This section details libraries and components under the "Tegral Web" name, as well as libraries that, while not strictly web-related, are intended for integration in Tegral Featureful-based applications.
