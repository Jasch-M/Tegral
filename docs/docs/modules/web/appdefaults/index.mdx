# TW AppDefaults

Tegral Web AppDefaults is a [feature](/modules/core/featureful/index.mdx) for Tegral-based applications.

<PackageVersions libraries={[
    { name: 'tegral-web-appdefaults', catalog: 'web.appdefaults' }
]}/>

It provides sane defaults for Web applications. Most notably:

- It provides the `DefaultKtorApplication` class, which is a [`KtorApplication`](/modules/web/controllers/index.mdx#ktorapplication) implementation that uses the Tegral Web configuration and sets up basic features like [content negotiation](https://ktor.io/docs/serialization.html#receive_send_data) with [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson).

- It provides the `KeepAliveService` class, which is a service that simply keeps the application alive while the application is `start`ed. This is required for Ktor applications, since all threads used by Ktor are [daemon threads](https://www.baeldung.com/java-daemon-thread) which do not actually keep the JVM running.

- It also provides a default [configuration class](/modules/core/config/sections.md#defining-the-class), meaning that you do not have to define your own `Config` class if you intend on only using the `[tegral]` section.

- It automatically configures the default loggers for a better out-of-the-box experience. For logger configuration, see the [Tegral Logging feature](/modules/core/logging/index.mdx).

The AppDefaults feature also has a dependency on the Tegral Services feature and on [Tegral Web Controllers](/modules/web/controllers/index.mdx) and sets up the `[tegral.web]` configuration section (i.e. `WebConfiguration`)

[AppDSL](/modules/web/appdsl/index.mdx) automatically installs AppDefaults, meaning that you do not need to install AppDefaults yourself if you use AppDSL.
